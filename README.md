# Simple Admin
A chrome extension designed to make searching the SCCRM admin portal easier. 

This project uses Webpack & Babel to compile modules and transpile ES6 down to ES5 compatible code.

After cloning, use `npm install` to download this project's dependencies. 

To build the extension, use `npm run build`. This will create a build folder in the project's root directory
if one doesn't already exist and dump the output from Babel into it. 

To add the extension to Chrome, navigate to More Tools â†’ Extensions and turn on development mode in the upper right hand corner. Next, click the 'Choose Upload' button and select the build folder (not the root directory).
