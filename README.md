# simpleadmin
A chrome extension designed to make searching the SCCRM admin portal easier. 

This project uses Webpack & Babel to compile modules and transpile ES6 down to ES5 compatible code.

After cloning, use `npm install` to download this project's dependencies. 

To build the extension, use `npm run build`. This will create a build folder if one doesn't already exists in the project's root directory
and write the webpack / babel output to it.
